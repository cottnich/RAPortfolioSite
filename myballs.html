    <h1>Meet RA Nicholas Cotton</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hi! My name is <strong>Nicholas Cotton</strong>, and I’m so excited to be your RA this year. Outside of my studies in <strong>Math and Computer Science</strong>, I love exploring <strong>vintage tech</strong>, tinkering with projects (like modding my espresso machine), and making music on my <strong>trombone</strong> and <strong>bass</strong>. I also develop tools to enhance my <strong>Linux environment</strong>—it's a fun way to combine creativity and problem-solving.</p>
        <p>On a personal note, I’m <strong>half Okinawan</strong>, and I hold a deep connection to my Pacific Island and Japanese heritage. Sharing stories and connecting over diverse backgrounds is something I value, and I hope to foster a community where we all feel comfortable being ourselves.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>My Strengths</h2>
        <p>Using my CliftonStrengths, here’s what you can expect from me:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Restorative:</strong> I thrive on solving problems and finding creative ways to improve things. Whether it’s helping a resident work through a challenging situation or debugging a piece of code, I’ll always tackle the issue head-on.</li>
            <li><strong>Learner:</strong> I’m always eager to grow and explore. I see our community as an opportunity for shared learning, where we can exchange ideas and grow together.</li>
            <li><strong>Self-Assurance:</strong> Confidence is key when facing challenges, and I bring a steady sense of assurance when managing conflict or leading events.</li>
            <li><strong>Analytical:</strong> I love breaking down complex problems into manageable parts. This strength helps me provide thoughtful guidance and support, especially during tough conversations or decision-making moments.</li>
            <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Fairness and stability are important to me. I strive to create an environment where everyone feels valued and included, and where expectations are clear.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>What is an RA?</h2>
        <p>Being an RA means building a supportive and welcoming community where residents can thrive. It’s about being a <strong>mentor</strong>, a <strong>listener</strong>, and a <strong>problem-solver</strong>. Whether it’s a late-night chat about life or organizing a fun event, I’m here to help you make the most of your time at Penn State.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Transferable Skills</h2>
        <p>Here are some skills I’ve developed as an RA that I’ll take into my future career in <strong>Data Science</strong> or <strong>Software Engineering</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Conflict Resolution:</strong> Handling delicate situations has taught me to navigate complex interpersonal dynamics, a skill essential for teamwork in any field.</li>
            <li><strong>Organization:</strong> Managing events and tasks as an RA sharpens my ability to prioritize and stay organized, even under pressure.</li>
            <li><strong>Empathy:</strong> Supporting residents with compassion and understanding makes me a better collaborator, especially in roles that require user-focused solutions.</li>
            <li><strong>Communication:</strong> From writing professional incident reports to leading discussions, clear and effective communication is a skill I’ll carry forward.</li>
            <li><strong>Adaptability:</strong> Living and working in a dynamic environment has prepared me to tackle unexpected challenges with confidence and flexibility.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Why Community Builders Matter</h2>
        <p>Community builders are at the heart of what makes residence life meaningful. My goal is to create spaces where everyone feels <strong>included</strong> and <strong>supported</strong>. One of my favorite events this semester was hosting a <strong>Super Smash Bros. Melee Tournament</strong> in collaboration with PSU’s Smash Club. While attendance wasn’t massive, it brought together a passionate group of people for an unforgettable night of competition and camaraderie.</p>
        <p>I hope residents gain new friendships, confidence, and a sense of belonging from the events we host.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>My Theory of Student Development</h2>
        <p>I believe that growth happens in a <strong>supportive yet challenging environment</strong>. Living in our community means stepping out of your comfort zone, discovering new perspectives, and finding the courage to be yourself. My hope is that by the end of the year, you’ll feel more confident, capable, and connected to the world around you.</p>
