        <h2>My Theory of Student Development</h2>
	<p>I believe that growth happens in a <strong>supportive yet challenging environment</strong>. Living in our community means stepping out of your comfort zone, discovering new perspectives, and finding the courage to be yourself. My hope is that by the end of the year, you’ll feel more confident, capable, and connected to the world around you.

        <h3>Chickering's Seven Vectors</h3>
        <p>
            Chickering's Seven Vectors provide a framework for understanding the development of college students, focusing on areas such as identity, interpersonal relationships, and purpose. These vectors outline the ways students grow during their college years and offer insights into how environments can support that growth. As an RA, I see the impact of fostering meaningful relationships and encouraging self-discovery in my residents. The theory underscores the importance of creating spaces where students feel safe to explore their identities and make purposeful decisions. However, one limitation of this theory is that it assumes a linear progression, which may not account for the non-linear realities of student development.

        <h3>Tinto's Theory of Student Departure</h3>
        <p>
            Tinto's Theory focuses on the reasons why students leave college and emphasizes the importance of integration into the academic and social environments of a campus. It suggests that students are more likely to persist when they feel a sense of belonging and connection. This has directly informed my approach to community building as an RA. I strive to create inclusive events and foster relationships that help residents feel integrated into the broader campus community. A challenge with this theory is its limited application to commuter or non-traditional students, whose experiences might differ significantly.

        <h3>Sanford's Theory of Challenge and Support</h3>
        <p>
            Sanford's Theory highlights the balance between challenging students to grow and providing adequate support to help them succeed. It argues that too much challenge without support can lead to frustration, while too much support without challenge can hinder growth. As an RA, this theory has shaped how I approach conflict resolution and developmental conversations with residents. For instance, when addressing behavioral issues, I focus on holding students accountable while offering the resources they need to make better choices. However, applying this balance effectively requires a deep understanding of each individual’s unique needs.
